with xordiff encoding: encode blocks, eg 4x4

* arithmetic codec which adjusts probabilities on the go:
  - start with all probabilities at 1 up to max symbol
  - every time after encoding a symbol increment its probability

* bring-to-front filter:
  - initially map all symbols to themselves
  - every time a symbol S occurs, record it as S but also remap it onto a symbol between 0 and S, eg S / 2.

* burrows-wheeler



* x/y methods in IntField
* stop using Position in foreseeers

* pick best size
* full encode/decode
* save intermediate png's

* queue images and allow to flick through them. Also add scrolling. Generate them in a separate thread


SELECT-AND-FILTER IN ONE GO



Future improvements:
* pre-pass to remove backgrounds and horz/vert boundaries?
* multi-color predictor
* auto-align on letter boundaries (requires flexible size foreseer)
* adaptive arithmetic

* super-slow-and-advanced predictor: order colors by frequency but keep all colors

Speedups:
* Accessor class for images, incrementing it advances to next element in a pre-defined direction
