----do try lzw on regions where whitespace is excluded. Try limiting the length of words created. Try visualising to ensure it works
----find black regions instead of white - these can overlap. Pick them in the order where next rect adds the most new black coverage
----for white regions: don't encode height, encode end of stream instead?

* skip pixels already encoded in one field?

* arithmetic codec which adjusts probabilities on the go:
  - start with all probabilities at 1 up to max symbol
  - every time after encoding a symbol increment its probability

* with xordiff encoding: encode blocks, eg 4x4

* bring-to-front filter:
  - initially map all symbols to themselves
  - every time a symbol S occurs, record it as S but also remap it onto a symbol between 0 and S, eg S / 2.

* auto-align on letter boundaries (requires flexible size foreseer)
